-=< Tab Hardener >=-

Prevents teachers from closing your tabs.

Setup: Create a bookmark, copy the provided code and paste it in as the URL (name it whatever you want).

javascript:window.onbeforeunload = function() { return true;};



When a teacher attempts to close a tab with this script running,
a message will pop up on your screen saying that changes might
be lost if you leave the site without saving. You can hit cancel
(keep tab open) or leave (close tab).
